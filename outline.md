# Initiative tracker outline

 ## Introduction
 - App will track the turn order of players in a specified campaign
 - It has been voiced by those around me that this sort of application may be useful as combat turn order functionality is missing in many mainstream DND applications

 ## User Interface
- ### Campaign list page
    - Page will be for campaigns. There will be a button to add a new campaign, which will take you to another page to fill out character info for the campaign.
    - Each campaign in the campaigns page will be a clickable element, which will take the user to the respective campaign.
- ### Add campaign page
    - Page will be for filling out pertinent info about the campaign such as the name of the campaign and associated characters.
    - It will include a button that adds a character field, in which a name can be entered for that character
    - Will include a button for submiting the campaign. Once that has happened, the user will be taken back to the campaign page, where the newly populated campaign will appear. 
- ### Campaign page 
    - Page is to display all of the characters and allow user to change initiatives 
    - A start combat button will be included to start turn order tracking, which will take the user to the combat page
- ### Combat page 
    - Page will have each character as a box-like element, displayed in order of turn. 
    - Each character element will have button options to add effects.
